Upgraded manually since react-native-git-upgrade didn't work (cuz babel compiler has changed)

Used instructions from:
https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/ce05d53b5e7b3f11234a3cbac6ef7a47ac26fe3f/CHANGELOG.md#updating-to-this-version

Faced Issues:

https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8284
solution: change "@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators": "7.1.2" in package.json

https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21150
solution: yarn add -D schedule@0.4.0
